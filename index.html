                Web browsing is inefficient for blind web users because of persistent accessibility problems, but the extent of these problems and their practical effects from the perspective of the user has not been sufficiently examined. We conducted a study <i>in situ</i> to investigate the accessibility of the web as experienced by web users. This remote study used an advanced web proxy that leverages <abbr title=" Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr> technology to record both the pages viewed and the actions taken by users on the web pages that they visited. Our study was conducted remotely over the period of one week, and our participants used the assistive technology and software to which they were already accustomed and had already configured according to preference. These advantages allowed us to aggregate observations of many users and to explore the practical effects on and coping strategies employed by our blind participants. Our study reflects web accessibility from the perspective of web users and describes quantitative differences in the browsing behavior of blind and sighted web users.

                We used an advanced web proxy to enable our study and quantitatively measured both the presence and observed effectiveness of components thought to impact web accessibility. Most proxy systems can only record HTTP requests and cannot easily discern user actions performed on web pages. We used an enhanced version of UsaProxy to record participants' browsing. UsaProxy can record actions that are impossible to record with a traditional proxy, such key presses, clicks on arbitrary page elements (including within-page anchor links), and the use of the "back" button to return to a page that was previously viewed. Recording user actions has traditionally required study participants to install specialized browser plugins, but UsaProxy is able to record most user actions by using Javascript code that is injected into pages that are viewed. Because it uses Javascript to parse the viewed web pages, it can also record dynamic page changes, interaction with dynamic content and <abbr title=" Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr> requests, which are an increasingly important accessibility concern. A proxy approach enables transparent setup by participants and allows them to use their own equipment with its existing configuration.
